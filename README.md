# Blockchain Oriented Instant Cheque Settlement System
The Indian financial system heavily relies on cheques as a payment instrument. While the Cheque Truncation System (CTS) has brought some improvements, it still suffers from limitations inherent to physical cheques and manual processing. Manual processing of cheques introduces delays and human error, affecting the clearance process and impacting cash flow. Physical cheques require secure transportation, storage, and printing, leading to operational costs and risk of loss, damage, or theft. The current system also introduces security vulnerabilities such as forged signatures, counterfeit cheques, and unauthorized alterations, further compromising the security of transactions. The existing system offers limited transparency for users regarding the status of their cheques during clearance. Real-time tracking of cheque movement is not readily available. Cheque clearance times can take several days, hindering access to funds and impacting financial planning. These limitations 
highlight the need for a modernized cheque clearance system that is more efficient, secure, and transparent. This project proposes a novel solution: a secure and efficient blockchain based digital cheque system designed to revolutionize the cheque clearance process in India.
